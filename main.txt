Hi <Enter name>!
We went through the website you provided. Most of the things we need are already implemented there. 
However we need to implement the system for a school. As we are tight on budget we cannot bear the cost of in house development for deployment of a single system. It would be great if you could provide us the system for a school. 
Here are the requirements: 
1. List of students with in-out time and ability to search by data (Implemented).
2. List of in-out time for a specific student sorted by date (implemented).
3. Ability to search student by class and section along with id (Need to implement) 
--> the existing website already has the system implemented. We only need two extra filters: class, section.
4. Register/Re-register (in case of card lost) and de-register a student, staff member and teacher
5. Ability to search users by role (Staff/Teacher/Student).
These are the basic requirements we need for this project. 
It would be helpful if you could modify the existing system a bit to meet our requirements. Please let us now the feasibility of the requirements and the extra charge you need for the implementation. 
Thanks and Regards,
